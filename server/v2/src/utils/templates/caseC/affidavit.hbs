                    That I am the {{affidavit.rel}} of the Accused/Applicant in this application
                    by virtue of which I am conversant with the facts leading to the

                </li>
                <li>
                    That I have the authority and consent of the Accused/Applicant

                </li>
                <li>
                    That the Applicant told me in the {{arrested_on}} at the
                    Correctional Center of {state_arraigned}, Nigeria
                    and I verily believed him.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Applicant was arrested on the {{arrested_on}}, by

                    All efforts made by me and members of our family to secure the

                </li>
                <li>
                    That the Accused/Applicant spent {{station_duration}} days in detention at the {applicant.station},

                <li>
                    That I know as a fact that from the {{arrested_on}},
                    when the Applicant was arrested till date, the Nigeria Police
                    Force should have concluded investigation, if any fact exist of
                    any crime at all.

                <li>

                    magistrate court where
                    the sitting magistrate denied jurisdiction of the said matter. The charge sheet is hereby attached
                    and marked as
                    Exhibit A.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That the accused was arrested since the {{arrested_on}}, and
                    was in police
                    detention until the {{arraigned_on}}, when he was arraigned
                    before the lower
                    court that declined jurisdiction and ordered his remand at the {applicant.state_arraigned}
                    Correctional Center
                    pending Director of Public Prosecution’s advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That the Director of Public Prosecution works directly under the 1st Respondent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That plea of the Applicant was not taken at the Magistrate Court on the
                    {{arraigned_on}}, when he was arraigned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That from the date of the arrest of the accused person on {{arrested_on}},
                    till the date of this application, is {{months}} months and an information/proof of
                    evidence is yet to be
                    filed against the applicant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That since then there has been no proof/evidence filed at the high court and the applicant has been
                    in prison
                    without trial.
                </li>
                <li>That the applicant if granted bail will be available to face his trial whenever called upon to do
                    so.</li>
                <li>
                    That the Applicant informed me in the {{arrested_on}} during
                    my visit to the
                    prison that he has reasonable and responsible sureties within the jurisdiction of this honourable
                    court who are
                    ready to take him on bail to guarantee his continuous attendance to court to face his trial, if
                    information is
                    eventually filed against him.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That he will not interfere with police investigation of the case, if any, when admitted to bail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That there is no witness whose life will be endangered if the Applicant is admitted to bail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That i know as a fact that, unless this court admits the Applicant to bail, the respondent will
                    continue to detain
                    the Applicant in their unlawful, wrongful, and unconstitutional detention, even when there are
                    reasonable persons to
                    take the Applicant on bail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That the grant of this application will not prejudice the
                    respondent as the applicant is in no way involved in the crime
                    for which he is alleged to have committed.
                </li>

                <li>
                    That I know as a fact that, unless this court enforces the
                    Applicant’s Fundamental Right, the respondent will continue to
                    detain the Applicant in their unlawful, wrongful, and
                    unconstitutional detention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That the grant of this application will be in the interest of
                    justice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    That i swear to this Oath solemnly and conscientiously believing
                    its contents to be true and correct in accordance with the Oath
                    Act.
