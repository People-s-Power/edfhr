            <h6>ARGUMENT</h6>
            <p>
                We now advance our argument in furtherance of the hearing of this
                application or motion on notice. My lord, the motion on notice is
                dated the ________________________ day of
                _____________­­­­­_________ 2019 and filed pursuant to the Rules
                (supra). My Lord, the Applicant while filing the Application for
                the redress of the infringement of his Fundamental Rights filed
                alongside the motion, a statement pursuant to Order 2 Rule 3 of
                the Rule (Supra). The said statement contains in paragraph 1, the
                name and the description of the Applicant. Paragraph 2 of the same
                statement contains the reliefs sought by the Applicant while
                paragraph 3 sets out in sub paragraphs (1) and (2) provides for
                the grounds upon which the reliefs are sought, which include a
                statement of facts relating to the transaction that warranted this
                suit. The Applicant also filed a 12 paragraphs Affidavit which is
                properly deposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Lord, we propose to argue the motion by raising certain
                fundamental issues upon which we shall anchor our submissions. The
                issues are now raised as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whether this Application is brought within time or whether the
                    Applicant’s claim of a likelihood of an infringement of his
                    Fundamental Rights falls within those rights set out in Chapter
                    IV of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, as to warrant bringing
                    this Application under the Fundamental Rights Rules(supra)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether the Court can grant ancillary reliefs connected to the
                    facts of the alleged violation of the Applicant’s Fundamental
                    Rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether it is proper in law for the Respondents to interfere
                    with the Applicant’s Fundamental rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether the actions of the Respondents as stated by the
                    Applicant in the statement of facts constitute an infringement
                    of the Applicant’s fundamental rights for which the Applicant is
                    entitled to seek for redress under the Rules(supra)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether this Court has the Jurisdiction to entertain this suit
                    where some of the Respondents are Police officers or supposed
                    agents of the Federal Government.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether the Court can grant Monetary Relief in an application
                    for redress of the infringement of Fundamental Rights.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 1</h6>
            <p>
                On the issue as to whether the application was brought within time
                and whether the Applicant’s claim of the infringement falls within
                the rights set out in Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution of
                Nigeria as amended. We submit that the Applicant stated that the
                infringement by the Respondents started as was stated in paragraph
                1 to V of the grounds upon which the reliefs are sought that the
                respondents who arrested and continuously detaining the Applicant
                did so for no justifiable reason. We also submitted that the
                Applicant stated that on the
                {{arrested_on}}, the
                Respondents arrested him and detained him for than three months
                for no just cause and without preferring any charge against him.
                My Lord the first arm of issue No1 as raised by the Applicant is
                whether this application was brought in time. In answer, we submit
                that the application was brought within time as stipulated under
                the Rules (Supra). The Law is that an Application may be brought
                at any time during or after the discontinuation of the
                infringement. This Application was filed within time. We refer My
                Lord to see the case of Uzoukwu vs. Ezeonu II (1991) 8 NWLR (pt
                200) at page 700.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the second arm of this Issue as raised by the Applicant, we
                submit that the claim of infringement by the Applicant conforms
                with those rights under Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution as
                amended for which an Application of this nature can be made under
                the Rules (supra).
            </p>
            <p>
                My Lord, the Applicant is complaining of infringement of his
                fundamental rights of right to dignity of human person, right to
                his liberty against detention, torture and inhuman and degrading
                treatment, right to privacy of home and as provided for by section
                34(1) (a), 35(1)(3), (4), 37 of the Constitution (supra). We
                submit that the claim against the Respondents for the infringement
                or likelihood of an infringement of the Applicant’s fundamental
                rights forms the principal reason or claim in this Application. We
                refer My Lord to see reliefs (1), (2),, and (3) of the motion on
                notice. We submit that these fall within the specifications of
                those rights provided for under Chapter IV of the Constitution
                (supra). We submit also that base on the assertion in the
                principal claim; the Court can make inquiry and order on other
                ancillary reliefs sought. We shall come to the issue of
                jurisdiction later.
            </p>
            <p>
                We submit that this application is competent as the reliefs sought
                are similar to and are directly connected to those rights
                protected under Chapter IV of the Constitution (supra). We also
                submit that the Application has clearly established malice and
                intention to cause the Applicant pain and humiliation as well as
                pushing him.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also state that where a breach of likely breach of the
                provision of Chapter IV of the Constitution (supra) forms part of
                the principal claims then the provisions of the Rules (supra) can
                be invoked against the ancillary claims. We urge My Lord to see
                Din vs. A.G Federation (1988) 4 NWLR (pt 87) 147 cited in Dongtoe
                vs. Civil Service Commission (2001) 1 SCM page 59 at 69.
            </p>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 2 </h6>
            <p>
                On the issue as to whether the Court can grant ancillary reliefs
                connected to the facts of the alleged violation or likelihood of a
                violation of the Applicant’s fundamental rights, we submit that by
                the combine effects of Sections 35(6) and 46 of the 1999
                Constitution as amended and under the enabling laws of this
                courts, the court can grant ancillary reliefs in a fundamental
                rights application provided the principal claim is within those
                rights specified under Chapter IV of the Constitution (supra).
            </p>
            <p>
                We submit that the arrest and threat to re-arrest the Applicant,
                even when it is manifestly clear that the Applicant is innocent
                and committed no crime over an obvious and vindictive conduct of
                the complainant so as to subject him to humiliation and
                dehumanization and to deprive him of right to run his business, is
                wrong and that the constitution of the country (supra) as amended
                empowers the Applicant to seek remedy vide this action. we submit
                that apart from the arrest of the Applicant by the Respondents at
                the behest of the complainant, the conduct of the Respondents has
                instilled fear into the Applicant, as he has became weary of his
                freedom and suffered pain and pecuniary loss and is living under
                imminent fear and his detention without trial has complicated his
                business as free citizen and which in turn endangers his means of
                livelihood.
            </p>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 3</h6>
            <p>
                On the issue as to whether it is proper in law for the Respondents
                to interfere with the fundamental rights of the Applicant, we
                submit that our argument tn issue No. 1 above has covered our
                submission here. However, we add that the intervention of the
                Legislature in enacting the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement
                Procedure) Rules (supra) is to provide for a mechanism to redress
                any infringement of those rights provided for under Chapter IV of
                the Constitution (supra). We further submit that if My Lord looks
                at the entire grounds upon which this application is brought, my
                Lord will see that it is the complainant that sets the machinery
                of the Respondents rolling against the Applicant. We submit that
                the words of Sections 34, 35, 37 and 46 of the Constitution
                (supra) are very clear and unambiguous as the same in clear terms
                set out to protect the Applicant against the infringement of this
                rights against the conduct of the Respondents in this matter. We
                urge My Lord to give effect to the ordinary meaning of the words
                in the above relevant sub-sections of the sections 34, 35, 37 and
                46 of the 1999 Constitution (supra) and to hold that the
                Respondents have no rights or any legal basis to interfere with
                the fundamental rights aforesaid of the Applicant.
            </p>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 4</h6>
            <p>
                On issue No. 4 raised by the Applicant, we submit also that our
                submission in issue 1 and No. 3 above have adequately covered our
                arguments here and we adopt the same. However, we further submit
                that the action of the respondents which is the arrest, abduction,
                detention and dehumanization of the Applicant is contrary to the
                general provisions of sections 34, 35 and 47 of the Constitution
                (supra) and under the Rules (supra). We urge My Lord to hold so.
            </p>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 5</h6>
            <p>
                On issue as to whether the Court has Jurisdiction to entertain
                this application considering the status of all the Respondents, we
                submit that the enforcement of fundamental rights is a special
                proceeding which derives its validity from Constitutional
                provisions and under the Rules (supra) made or the Constitution
                (supra). We refer My Lord to see all Respondents are not Federal
                agents within the meaning of the provisions of Section 251(1)(g)
                and (r) of the Constitution (supra).
            </p>
            <h6>ISSUE NO. 6</h6>
            <p>
                On the issue whether this Court can assess and award damages to
                the Applicant in this application, we submit that by the
                provisions of section 46(2) of the 1999 Constitution (supra) as
                amended, and under the enabling laws of this court, the court can
                assess and make awards of monetary compensations by way of damages
                to the Applicant. We submit that the measure of damages and other
                considerations thereto under this proceeding is not specie but one
                and the same as the court will consider in other cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                We urge my Lord to consider the circumstances of the Applicant,
                who is a business man and the violation of his fundamental rights
                and has been forced to live in fear and apprehension, and loss of
                income from long detention. We submit that the trauma of living in
                fear in detention of a police cell, torture and dehumanizing
                condition fall within the scope of what is contemplate under
                section 46(2) of the Constitution (supra) and we urge My Lord to
                so hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                We urge My Lord to see generally the Affidavit in support of the
                Motion which shows the Applicant did not Commit any offence
                especially as alleged by the respondents, who despite efforts to
                free the Applicant are in a rather primitive and mundane manner
                still detaining him with the aim to infringe on the Applicant’s
                fundamental rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                We submit that the Applicant has not just suffered trauma and
                humiliation but also has been subjected to heavy pecuniary loss as
                he has lost his freedom. We submit that the Applicant is entitled
                under the Law for monetary compensation by way of damages and we
                urge My Lord to grant the relief on the motion paper in favour of
                the Applicant.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, we submit generally that the Applicant through the
                processes filed in this proceeding particularly the statement,
                verifying Affidavits and exhibits filed has established his case
                against the Respondents. We also submit that the Respondents will
                not be able to offer any defence or controvert any of the
                depositions in the statement of facts and various affidavits of
                the Applicant.
            </p>
            <p>
                We urge My Lord to consider generally the following cases: Egbuonu
                vs. Borno Radio Television Corporation (1993) 4 NWLR (pt 285) 13,
                nagoruwa vs. IGP (1993) 5 NWLR (pt 193) 593, Obisi vs. Nigeria

            </p>
            <p>
                We urge My Lord to enter Judgement in favour of the Applicant in
                the terms of the claims in the motion paper. We move in terms of
                our motion paper. May it please the honourable court.
